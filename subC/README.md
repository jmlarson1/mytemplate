subC Amazing Optimization Method
======================================
We are pretending that this is an optimization tool with a MATLAB and a Python
implementation.  However, we imagine that it crucially distinct from both subA
and subB.  As such, it is included in its own python package 
[mytemplate2_pypkg](https://github.com/jared321/mytemplate/tree/main/mytemplate2_pypkg/src/mytemplate2).

Testing
=======
Since this tool is included in `mytemplate2_pypkg` via symlink, it should be tested through that package.
